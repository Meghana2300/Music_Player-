# Music_Player-
Intro :
  Python GUL framework

    This helps users to select the song from list and listen to music
Technologies:

          This is developed using PYTHON,HTML
          Using of  tkinter,Pygame
Pygame:  

                a free open-source cross-platfrom library for the development of multimedia applications 
                like video game using python
Tkinter: 

                Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the TK GUI toolkit.
                  Creating  a GUI application using TKinter is an easy task.

          
            
 Steps to follow:

             1. Creating a project on the any python software    
             
             2.create a class using class_name
# packages:
             3.import the packages like Pygame.
# libraries:
             4.import pygame
             
             5.import tkinter as tkr
             
             6.from tkinter.filedialog import askdirectory
             
             7.import os
# pygame code
            import all the packages and libraries 
            
            follow the code in the Music_player.py
            
            creating a functionality the require to the music player like play(),stop(),
            pause(),unpause()
            
            and packing these functions for action
            
            also have a HTML code for designing of those functions(buttons)
  
 Final output
 
              run the code
              it will open a python tkinter frame
              final select the folder
              choose the song
              and listen to the song
